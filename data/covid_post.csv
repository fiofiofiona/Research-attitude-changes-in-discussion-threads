2921,"I’m Dr. Tom Frieden, former CDC Director under Obama and President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives. Ask me anything about Covid and vaccines!","Hi! I’m excited about my second AMA. My name is Dr. Tom Frieden, I’m the President and CEO of [Resolve to Save Lives](https://resolvetosavelives.org/). I ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 8 years from 2009–2017. Before that, I was the Commissioner of the New York City Health Department. In [my first AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mm2uez/im_dr_tom_frieden_former_cdc_director_under_obama/), I answered your questions about vaccines, masks, and much more. I’m excited to share more information to address questions you have about the state of the pandemic right now.

A little about me: As head of CDC, I helped lead the U.S. and global response to the Ebola outbreak. I’ve written [more than 250](https://www.drtomfrieden.net/tom-frieden-scientific-publications) scientific articles about emerging health threats and public health policy. In NYC, I led efforts that rapidly stopped the largest outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ever to occur in the United States, and[ drove tuberculosis case rates down](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199507273330406) with a program that became a national and international model. When Covid first emerged, I [sounded the alarm early](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/30/next-pandemic-is-coming-were-not-prepared-it/) to focus on helping the world better understand and more effectively respond to the pandemic. Check out [my public health website](https://www.tomfriedenpublichealth.net/) if you're interested in learning more about my work.

Right now, the [Delta variant continues to rage](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/23/health/delta-variant-danger-frieden/index.html) globally and in many unvaccinated parts of the U.S, though cases appear to be coming down for now. It’s clear that many places will continue to struggle with clusters and outbreaks until vaccine production is ramped up substantially. I've [called on](https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1444345026226663424?s=20) Pfizer and Moderna to share their technology with other manufacturers globally, or millions could die from Covid avoidably—and the companies will be responsible for these deaths. 

Until we can vaccinate the world, it’s up to us to deploy simple protection measures to control spread. I recently wrote about how we need to [maximize control of Covid while minimizing its harm](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-delta-variant-and-beyond-learning-to-live-with-covid-11628866931?page=1) to our societies and economies. This includes protecting the most vulnerable, including the [health care workers](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/03/opinions/covid-19-vaccinations-health-and-care-workers-frieden-masiyiwa/index.html) who put their lives on the line every day to care for patients. Covid has changed the world as we know it and herd immunity may be an impossible dream, but we can limit death and disruption while getting back to our lives. In the long run, it's crucial that we learn the lessons of Covid and invest in our public health systems. Many deadly and expensive health threats are [optional](https://www.tomfriedenpublichealth.net/themespublications/addressing-health-injustice-racism-and-disparities).

Starting at 12 pm ET, ask me anything about Covid, the Delta variant, vaccines boosters, and public health—from vaccine equity to keeping schools open, CDC guidelines, or anything else you're curious about! I’m here to help.

**Edit: Well, it's past 1 pm and I'm signing off for today! Thanks for all of the great questions. Even more than a year and a half into the pandemic, we must continue to learn more about Covid and adapt.**

In addition to those agencies, the following sites have very detailed and highly reliable information about a broad range of COVID-19-related topic areas, including prevention, therapeutics, and vaccines.

* [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
* [World Health Organization](https://covid19.who.int/)
* [WHO Myth Busters](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters)
* [US FDA](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/counterterrorism-and-emerging-threats/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19)
* [Amref Health Africa](https://amref.org/coronavirus/)
* [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19)

# Scientific News Agencies

In general, quality of COVID-19 coverage varies broadly across news outlets. It's highly recommended that you [look at the reliability](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) of a news outlet when evaluating the quality of its information. Even the best news outlets, however, sometimes get things wrong or overinterpret scientific evidence beyond that is actually supported. Here are some science-oriented news outlets or scientific journal briefings that are useful for understanding the science as it develops in a more reliable way.

* [Science Media Centre](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/tag/covid-19/)
* [The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/)
* [STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/)
* [CIDRAP from the University of Minnesota](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/)
* [Nature Briefings](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=nature-briefing)
* [Science Magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/latest-news)

# Science Blogs

Though it's often not ideal to get your information from the blogosphere at large, there are some high-quality blogs and podcasts that are produced by highly qualified individuals and that present the data in a measured and responsible way.

* [In the Pipeline](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/)
* [This Week in Virology](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/)

# Science Twitter

Twitter is usually a terrible place to get high-quality information. These scientists tend to be the exception to that rule. Please note: though these scientists tend to be pretty reasonable in their interpretation and presentation of data, even these tweets should be interpreted with caution as the opinion of a single individual (albeit a highly trained and qualified one).

# More Technical Resources

As discussed below, these resources should be interpreted cautiously; they're often written in a very technical manner that may not be easy to understand, and the limitations of the data may not be immediately obvious without careful analysis. With that caveat, some very high quality sources of more technical, scientific information are:

* [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/)
* [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/)
* [Cell](https://www.cell.com/)
* [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/)
* [Nature](https://www.nature.com/)
* [US CDC MMWR](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)

# Some Notes of Caution

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a proliferation of interest in research and research studies. This is, of course, a good thing -- it's important for people to be informed about the state of the field and about the development of the science on this critical topic. However, it's also important to be cautious in interpreting scientific studies, even those presented in the best journals. It's well known that much work in the biological sciences is questionable and difficult to replicate, and a single study should never be taken as definitive in and of itself. Studies -- even in the top journals -- are not always high quality. There's always methodological issues with every study that is published, and being able to distinguish the important issues from the less relevant issues takes practice. Authors of scientific papers often make broad claims or may overgeneralize their results without having the data to fully support their interpretations; being able to identify when that is the case takes practice. And sometimes (rarely, but sometimes), researchers fake their data or otherwise engage in scientific misconduct. Without being able to place the study in the broader context of the scientific literature on that topic and related topics, it's easy to misinterpret or overinterpret studies.

One notable example of this phenomenon is the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database. This database is *not* a verified compilation of adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines (or any vaccine); this database compiles self-reported, unverified claims from anyone that says they have been vaccinated and chooses to send them an alleged adverse event that happened after they got vaccinated. There is virtually no attempt made to verify or confirm the truth of these claims, let alone their association with the vaccine; in one famous example, a doctor [reported that the flu vaccine turned him into the Hulk](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/11/bill-zedler/bill-zedler-insists-program-doesnt-collect-wide-ra/), and it was accepted to the database. The purpose of VAERS is very limited -- it is meant to provide highly trained and qualified researchers to analyze the data for statistical aberrations with *considerable* effort needed to sort out the garbage from the potentially true signal. And even then, VAERS analysis is just the beginning; much more targeted and rigorous studies are needed to actually determine whether an adverse event is vaccine related. Basically, VAERS is a tool that can be used as a hypothesis generator for researchers -- it should not be interpreted to actually resemble anything even approaching reality.

The point is: when looking for information about COVID-19, exercise caution. Even the sources we have listed above sometimes get things wrong -- sometimes because new data causes a reevaluation of hypotheses and models, and sometimes just because humans make mistakes. Don't get your information from any one source, and don't take any one viewpoint to be the gospel.

Even then, expect to be wrong sometimes -- we've all been wrong at points throughout this pandemic. What's more important is to be willing to update your views as you get more information and to not hold steadfastly in the face of evidence to the contrary. If you look for good sources of information, think critically about it, and are willing to accept change, you'll probably be fine.",1629937654.0,811.0

5055,"FAQ: Recent CDC Guidance, Vaccine Data, and the Delta Variant","In light of the recent announcements by the Centers for Disease Control, we felt it would be a good idea to have a post briefly laying out and answering some common questions.

Last Thursday, the [Washington Post](https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/54f57708-a529-4a33-9a44-b66d719070d9/note/7335c3ab-06ee-4121-aaff-a11904e68462.) obtained a copy of the CDC's presentation on vaccine efficacy and the Delta variant. In it, they discuss and summarize recent available evidence on the transmissibility of the variant, its ability to cause severe disease, and how this impacts vaccines. We'll try to break this down here.

## What did the recent CDC announcement say about the Delta variant?

Over the last several months, the Delta variant has become highly prevalent in many parts of the world, including the United States, which has prompted and enabled more detailed study of spread and virulence. For context, the CDC estimates that the ancestral strains of SARS-CoV-2 have an R0 of roughly 1.5-4, meaning that in an immunologically naive population, each case of COVID-19 will, on average, result in 1.5-4 transmission events. The Delta variant, by contrast, is now believed to have an R0 between 5-9, making it an even more highly transmissible virus. This means that the Delta variant is believed to have a transmissibility on the same order of magnitude as varicella-zoster virus (the virus that causes chickenpox), which is highly transmissible.

This is estimate is supported by clinical data on Delta variant infection. [A cohort study of Indian HCWs](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-637724/v1) suggests that the Delta variant is associated with (very roughly) 5-6x higher viral loads in the nasopharynx than are ancestral strains. Unpublished data internal data from the CDC corroborates these estimates in the United States. In a similar vein, work from [Singapore](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3861566) indicates that, on average, PCR is able to detect viral particles for 5 days longer in infections with the Delta variant over ancestral strains.

Combined with the Indian report showing an association between the Delta variants and larger transmission cluster sizes, this data all supports the transmission dynamics estimate of R0 to support the notion that **the Delta variant is markedly more transmissible than are ancestral strains**.

Further, it is now believed that the Delta variant has a somewhat worse prognosis in the unvaccinated than do ancestral strains of SARS-Cov-2. Cohort studies from [Canada](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.05.21260050v2), [Singapore](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3861566), and [Scotland](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34139198/) have all separately indicated that the delta variant is roughly 2-4x as likely as previous variants to cause hospitalization or death in the unvaccinated.

## What did the CDC say about the impact of the Delta variants on vaccine efficacy?

The big takeaway from the CDC announcement is that **if you are fully vaccinated, you are highly protected against poor outcomes**, even in the face of the Delta variant. (Barring special medical conditions or immunocompromised states.)

Evaluation of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in [Scotland](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34139198/), [England](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658v1), [England again](https://khub.net/web/phe-national/public-library/-/document_library/v2WsRK3ZlEig/view/479607266), and [Canada](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v2) have reported an 80-90% efficacy against symptomatic infection with a 96-100% efficacy against hospitalization or death with the Delta variant. Though [Israeli data](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/06072021-04) showed lower efficacy in preventing confirmed or symptomatic infection (albeit still quite high -- on the order of 64%), it still showed a 93% efficacy against hospitalization or death.

Taking the data in totality, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is still moderately-to-highly efficacious in preventing infection or symptomatic COVID-19, with very high efficacy against poor outcomes. Data on other vaccines is more limited, but the English study suggests similar findings of moderate efficacy in preventing infection and very high protection against poor outcomes for the AstraZeneca vaccine.

With all that said, it appears that the Delta variant is associated with more breakthrough cases. All of the above studies observed a decrease in vaccine efficacy in preventing infection with the Delta variant compared to the Alpha variant. Further, the Delta variant seems to be associated with higher nasopharyngeal (nose and throat area) viral load in those breakthrough cases. The previously mentioned Indian cohort study and internal United States surveillance tracking were studies of breakthrough cases.

In addition, in a [report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm) on an outbreak of Delta variant cases in Massachusetts, it was found that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections had similar nasopharyngeal viral loads to those measured from unvaccinated individuals in the same outbreak. Though the sample sizes and relatively distinctive circumstances of the outbreak preclude generalization about vaccine efficacy, the RT-qPCR data here appears to corroborate the concerns raised by the Indian report and the internal CDC tracking of breakthrough cases, suggesting that vaccinated individuals *with breakthrough infections* are likely as capable of transmitting the Delta variant as are unvaccinated infected individuals.

It was on the basis of these data and the resultant modeling of outbreak probabilities that the CDC recommended a return to universal masking in areas of ongoing ""substantial"" or ""high"" transmission.

## What does the CDC announcement NOT say?

The CDC announcement has been widely misinterpreted and misrepresented over the last week.

First of all, this does NOT mean that vaccinated individuals are as likely to transmit the virus as unvaccinated individuals. The CDC announcement and the data all seem to suggest that vaccinated individuals *with breakthrough infections* with the Delta variant are likely as contagious as unvaccinated infected individuals, but the same sources all clearly show that the vaccines remain moderately-to-highly efficacious in preventing infections in the first place. In other words, a vaccinated and infected individual may be as likely to transmit the virus as an unvaccinated individual, but even with the Delta variant, the vaccinated individual is markedly less likely to get infected in the first place.

In addition, this data does not suggest that vaccinated individuals have *higher* viral loads than unvaccinated individuals. I have no idea where that idea has even come from -- presumably from misreading the axes on some of these graphs? -- but it's completely wrong.

## What about that study out of Israel suggesting that the vaccine only has 39% efficacy?

The study was plagued with methodological problems -- including, amongst others, an error that drastically affected the results due to a misestimation of the number of vaccinated individuals in total. [One of the individuals that was working on the study does a much better job of explaining the problem with their analysis here.](https://mobile.twitter.com/dvir_a/status/1420059124700700677)

## Are there any other interesting tidbits from the CDC announcement that don't fit neatly into another question?

Yes, there are! Thanks for asking!

The CDC presentation showed three studies across different healthcare systems that assessed for efficacy against hospitalization and symptomatic infection after the second dose of the mRNA vaccines and overwhelmingly found that there is **no evidence of waning immunity** for at least 14-20 weeks after the second dose -- those studies remain ongoing, and we'll no doubt hear about them as they continue to track vaccine efficacy moving forward. (Note: they did not find evidence of waning immunity after that time; the data the CDC had just goes through that time, as the studies are still ongoing.)

Even in populations that are going to have many comorbidities that affect immune function, the vaccines have been effective. In the immunocompromised and immunosuppressed, various studies have found that the mRNA vaccines have roughly a 60-80% efficacy against hospitalization; though it's hard to specifically assess the efficacy for individual immunocompromising conditions by this study, that's nonetheless promising. Similarly, the mRNA vaccines appear to have roughly 85% efficacy in preventing severe disease in individuals in long term care facilities (e.g. nursing homes). Again, this is quite good news for a population with such high prevalence of significant comorbidities.

## What's the takeaway here?

Overall, the popular hype about the Delta variant is appropriate in magnitude but likely misguided in direction.

The Delta variant is almost certainly at least 2-6x more contagious than ancestral strains of SARS-CoV-2, quite likely causes more severe disease and worse prognoses. It is likely able to cause more infections in vaccinated individuals than are ancestral strains, and it and can very likely be transmitted by vaccinated individuals that become infected. As such, particularly in populations with low vaccine uptake or significant compromising comorbidities, the Delta variant poses a significant threat to the public health and health of the population.

However, it is also important to remember that, barring medical conditions or immunocompromised status, **if you are vaccinated, you are highly protected against poor outcomes**. You may still be able to be infected, you may still be able to transmit the virus to others, and you may even be more likely to face symptoms with the Delta variant than with ancestral strains. However, *all* available evidence shows that the vaccines remain highly efficacious in preventing severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death, even in the face of the Delta variant.

We have always known that in many parts of the world, 2021 would represent a transition period between the acute pandemic phase and the chronic endemic phase of this disease and, unfortunately, this new data on the Delta variant has shown that. Once again: there is zero evidence to suggest that the Delta variant meaningfully diminishes the capacity of the vaccines to prevent significant illness, but with these new data on the transmissibility of the virus, it becomes all the more important to engage in source control (read: masking) to reduce the spread of the virus to a level that is *sustainably* manageable by the health system.

Ask me anything!","Vaccines are the way out of this pandemic and the best way to protect us from coronavirus. More than 36 million people in the UK have had their first jab, and more than 20 million people in the UK have had their second dose, giving them the strongest possible protection. It’s really important that you take the vaccine when it’s offered to you.
 
I’m Dr Amalina Bakri a Clinical Research Fellow at the Institute of Global Health Innovation, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London. I was part of the research team recruiting participants for the vaccine trials in London. I have been involved in various public health campaigns on social media particularly with Public Health England. I’ll be answering your questions about the vaccination programme from 5:30pm BST on Friday 21stMarch. You can find out more at [nhs.uk/covidvaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/).

We've decided to test out a new feature for the subreddit to help users spread the word about getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Just like those sweet stickers you get at your local vaccination sites to show off your vaccinated status, we've enabled user flairs that display the following options

[\(Available vaccination status flairs\)  ](https://preview.redd.it/0bwcxsoyajx61.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffeb8d1bd2a58520d8bd23a00702bbc9a066e0df)

*Vaccine Flair Design by* u/woofwoofpack

This is just a test at the moment but we'd like to hear your feedback and hope that our users showing pride in their vaccination status can help encourage others to go get vaccinated themselves.

**How to set your own flair:** Look for “Community Options” or your username under the “Community Details” section found on the right side of the page. Click on “ADD USER FLAIR” just below your name. Choose your preferred flair from the list and click “APPLY” to save changes

There is no requirement to display a user flair if you don't want to, and as you would expect any harassment directed at a user for using these flairs will not be tolerated.

As you're all no doubt aware, vaccines have now been rolling out for several months, and we wanted to take some time to answer some commonly asked questions about what we've learned about the COVID-19 vaccines and to go over some of the recommendations about who should get vaccinated, what to expect, and usage of medications around vaccination.

If you have any questions, we're happy to answer them in the comments!

Special thanks to /u/YourWebcam for their help in research for this post!

# What do we know about the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines?

As of early December, we had trial data showing that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were both highly effective when administered in a two-dose regimen, reaching efficacies of roughly 94-95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. We also had trial data (albeit with many caveats) suggesting that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine had an efficacy of roughly 62% in preventing COVID-19 with two full doses and a standard 4 week dosing schedule; some small subgroup analyses suggested potentially higher efficacies with different doses, though this was complicated due to differences in sample size, population, and dosing time.

Since then, we have continued to learn about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines, both from clinical trials and from the broader rollout of the vaccines to the general public.

## Oxford/AstraZeneca

As of early December, clinical trial data suggested that the Oxford/AstraZeneca had an efficacy of roughly 62% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with the standard dosages and a four week gap between doses. Most recently, in the United States, a [Phase 3 trial](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html) found that the vaccine was 76% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% efficacious in preventing hospitalization and death with no significant safety concerns; it is expected that the vaccine will be submitted for Emergency Use Authorization in early April.

### Efficacy of One Dose

In their initial rollout, some nations chose to pursue a strategy of broadly administering the first dose to a greater number of people and planning to administer the second dose within 12 weeks rather than at four weeks.

To assess this strategy, researchers ran a clinical trial to answer two questions. First, the researchers wanted to determine whether administering a second dose after 12 weeks would result in robust protection against COVID-19. Second, the researchers wanted to determine whether one dose of the vaccine would offer adequate protection for at least 12 weeks.

The data from this trial, which was published in [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00432-3/fulltext), had positive findings on both of these questions. On the first point, the study found that after a 12 week administration schedule, the vaccine had an efficacy roughly 81%, compared to an efficacy of 55% when the second dose was administered within 6 weeks (though the confidence intervals overlapped between the two estimates). As such, the data suggested that at the very least, there was no significant difference between administering the vaccine within 6 weeks as opposed to delaying the vaccine for 12 weeks -- and potentially suggested a *higher* efficacy in the latter case. On the question of protection from a single dose, the authors found that the vaccine had an efficacy of 76% between the first dose and the second dose, suggesting that the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine offers enough protection to warrant delaying the second dose to 12 weeks if needed. Finally, in both these trials, the vaccine had 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

These effect sizes were borne out in practice as well. In [an analysis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1) of the effectiveness of the vaccine as it was rolled out in England through mid-February, it was found that this vaccine had a 60-73% efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease in individuals over the age of 70 after one dose, with that single dose of the vaccine estimated to be 80% effective at preventing hospitalization.

### Efficacy Against Variants

Some studies, though limited in number and scope, have perfunctorily assessed efficacy of this vaccine against different variants of the virus. In the lab, [one study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.435000v1) focusing on hamsters found that the vaccine was effective against both the B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) lineages of COVID-19. Studies of the efficacy of the vaccine in practice are more limited. One [study](Efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (B.1.1.7)) out of the UK found that this vaccine had similar efficacy between B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 lineages of COVID-19, suggesting that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be efficacious against B.1.1.7. However, [other studies](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102214?query=featured_home) focusing on the B.1.351 variant did not show efficacy of the vaccine in preventing mild-to-moderate COVID-19, though it is important to note that this study was small and likely very underpowered to detect any differences. Nonetheless, this suggests that this vaccine might potentially be less effective against the B.1.351 variant, though more research is needed on this point.

### Safety and Concerns about Clotting

In March 2021, some [concerns](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/03/30/blood-clots-and-the-az-vaccine-revisited) were raised about the safety of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine after some reports of clotting abnormalities across Europe. In response, though the European Medical Agency urged otherwise, many European nations elected to temporarily suspend vaccination with this vaccine for several days.

Many of the reported cases consisted of deep vein thromboses and pulmonary embolisms, which were occurring at roughly the rate expected for the general population. And indeed, in the United Kingdom, there has been no evidence of increased clotting abnormalities or thrombosis in the vaccinated population. However, in roughly 30 individuals across Europe, there have been reports of other conditions, including cerebral venous thromboses and thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and bleeding. It is still not known that these case reports are significantly above those expected in the general population as a whole; it is important to bear in mind that millions of individuals have received this vaccine to date, and the anticipated incidence is roughly in the single digits per *million* individuals vaccinated. However, [some early research](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/rare-clotting-disorder-may-cloud-worlds-hopes-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine) suggests that these cases bear some characteristics of vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), a condition in which the vaccine stimulates an immune response that causes platelets to form clots and become depleted. This condition is treatable with anticoagulants and immunoglobulin therapy, and it appears to occur primarily in younger populations -- though again, it is important to note that the incidence is on the order of a few cases per *million* vaccinated individuals.

Given the *extremely* low risk of this condition and the significantly greater benefit that the vaccine provides in preventing COVID-19, the European Medical Agency has stated that the benefits of the vaccine greatly outweigh its risks, even in younger individuals. Younger individuals, though less susceptible to COVID-19 than the elderly, still bear some risk from COVID-19, and that risk is *considerably* higher than the risk presented by these very infrequent clotting abnormalities. As such, the European Medical Agency has urged continued vaccination using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

## Pfizer/BioNTech

In late 2020, clinical trial data showed that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was roughly 95% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in individuals aged 16 or older, with more recent [continued data](https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study/default.aspx) from their trial showing that the vaccine remained effective even at six months after vaccination. More recently, the company has [announced](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal) that its trial of individuals aged 12-15 had similarly high efficacy and safety. On the basis of this data, this vaccine was widely authorized for use worldwide and has since been distributed to tens, if not *hundreds*, of millions of people. This has allowed for study of the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing COVID-19 in practice.

### Efficacy in Practice

Much of the data on the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in practice has come from Israel, where the vaccine has been rolled out broadly to a large proportion of its population. Here, we have found that the vaccine has been highly effective across the board. Two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine, it was [reported](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/20022021-01) that the vaccine is roughly 98% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with roughly 99% or greater efficacy at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, or death from COVID-19. [More recent reports](https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Real-World-Evidence-Confirms-High-Effectiveness-of-Pfizer-BioNTech-COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Profound-Public-Health-Impact-of-Vaccination-One-Year-After-Pandemic-Declared/default.aspx) have had similar findings, suggesting 97% efficacy or greater at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. Notably, these latter reports also found a 94% decrease in asymptomatic COVID-19 infections.

The [SIREN study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399) measured the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a set of healthcare workers in the United Kingdom, who were regularly tested for COVID-19 to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. They found, in total, that the vaccine was roughly 86% effective in preventing a COVID-19 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) one week after the second dose, which was not statistically significantly different from the Israeli findings.

### Efficacy of One Dose

The SIREN study also found that the vaccine was 76% efficacious 21 days after the first dose. This estimate is higher than that provided by a [similar study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399) in Israel, which found that one dose was 57% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 from 14-20 days after the first dose, although the results are not statistically significant. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that while two doses are needed for maximum protection, even one dose provides some amount of protection against COVID-19.

### Efficacy in Preventing Transmission

We do not have absolute, definitive data on the effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on transmission dynamics at this time. Nonetheless, we do have some amount of data that suggests the vaccine will reduce spread of the virus. First, as mentioned above, several studies have now found that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reduces infections rather than just symptoms; in particular, the vaccine is able to prevent a large proportion of asymptomatic infections. In addition, recent data out of Israel, published in [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01316-7), found that one dose of the vaccine was able to drastically reduce the viral load for those infections that did occur. Together, these results all suggest that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can drastically reduce the risk of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, potentially/likely reducing transmission after the same as well.

### Efficacy Against Variants

Some limited amount of data has emerged about the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against different variants of COVID-19. This data has, at times, been somewhat muddled and contradictory, in no small part because the lab studies on the topic have often used different methods to make their assessments, not all of which are as useful as others. However, in general, some broad statements can be made. First, as a recent [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01318-5) study noted, it is likely that the neutralizing titers of serum from vaccinated individuals will be lower against the B.1.1.7, P.1, and especially the B.1.351 variants of the virus (UK, Brazil, and South African variants, respectively).

However, it is important to maintain context on what lower titers actually mean; all it means is that there is *less* of the neutralizing antibody in the blood. That does not mean that there is not *enough* neutralizing antibody to still successfully suppress the virus. The gold standard for determining whether the neutralizing antibodies are able to stop the virus from infecting cells is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which measures whether the serum is able to prevent cell death after exposure to the virus. In a recent [study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017) to this effect, it was found that serum from individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was able to robustly neutralize all of the tested variants of the virus, including the B1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351 variants of the virus.

Finally, it is important to remember that antibody neutralization is *not* the same thing as vaccine immunity; there are many components of the immune response beyond antibody neutralization, and a poor antibody response does not preclude immunity against COVID-19.

Outside of lab data, the B.1.1.7 strain remain most prevalent in the United Kingdom and Israel, where many of the above efficacy studies appear to show high efficacy. In addition, though underpowered, the South African arm of the Pfizer trial showed 100% efficacy of the vaccine against severe infection which, in the context of the lab studies, strongly suggests the vaccine maintains significant efficacy against the B.1.351 variant.

## Moderna

In late 2020, clinical trial data (later published in the [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389)) showed that the Moderna vaccine was roughly 94% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with 100% efficacy against hospitalization and death. On the basis of this data, the Moderna vaccine was authorized in many jurisdictions and has since been distributed to large numbers of individuals. Due to the more limited supply of the Moderna vaccine than the Pfizer/BioNTech worldwide, the Moderna vaccine has not had as many large, nationwide studies specifically aimed at determining efficacy of the vaccine for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, though it is highly likely that given their highly similar mechanisms of action, properties found of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely hold for the Moderna vaccine. However, these studies are ongoing, as are clinical trials to test the vaccine in pediatric populations and to identify boosters against variants.

## Johnson & Johnson/Janssen

In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (hereafter abbreviated as J&J) announced that their Phase 3 trial found that their one-dose vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, with 85% efficacy against preventing clinically severe COVID-19 and no deaths in the vaccinated group due to COVID-19. On the basis of these data, the vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization in many jurisdictions around the world and has since been rolled out to millions of people.

This is, as noted above, a one-dose vaccine regimen at present. Studies on the efficacy of a two-dose regimen are currently ongoing, as are studies on the ability of the vaccine to prevent transmission of COVID-19.

### Efficacy Against Variants

The [J&J trial](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) was run around the world, allowing for assessment of the efficacy of the vaccine against different variants prevalent at different regions. Overall, the vaccine had an efficacy of 66%, but this varied across regions. In the United States, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy of roughly 72%, whereas in South Africa (where the B.1.351 variant is predominant), the vaccine had an efficacy of 64% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. The vaccine had roughly 68% efficacy against moderate to severe disease in Brazil, where the P.1 and P.2 variants are prevalent. Nonetheless, across the world, the vaccine remained highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. Trials are ongoing to determine if specific boosters against variants will improve efficacy of the vaccine.

## Novavax

In March 2021, Novavax [reported](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0#:~:text=NVX%2DCoV2373%20is%20being%20evaluated,that%20began%20in%20December%202020%20.) that their Phase 3 trial had reached its final analysis, showing that their vaccine was roughly 96% efficacious in preventing COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. However, this vaccine appeared significantly affected by the South African variant of COVID-19; in the South African arm of the trial, it was found to have an efficacy of roughly 55% in HIV-negative individuals. Nonetheless, the vaccine was highly effective in preventing severe disease, even in South Africa. Continued studies are ongoing to determine the efficacy of the vaccine against different variants. This vaccine candidate is currently not yet authorized in most jurisdictions.

# Who should get a COVID-19 vaccine?

The following sections will go through the [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html) and recommendations for vaccination. Depending on your jurisdiction, other regulatory agencies may have slightly different recommendations. This is not to be construed as medical advice; it is strictly a discussion of the CDC guidelines. If you have questions about your medical conditions and whether it poses a contraindication to vaccination, please speak with your physician.

It is currently recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be given to all people above the age of 16 that do not have medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated. Some regulators have subdivided different vaccines as being used for different populations; for example, the AstraZeneca vaccine, in some jurisdiction, is preferentially used for elderly populations, whereas the Pfizer vaccine is the only vaccine used for individuals between 16 and 18 years of age. However, in general, unless there is a medical contraindication to vaccination, all individuals are medically eligible to be vaccinated!

## Contraindications and Precautions to Vaccination

Per the [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html), the only absolute contraindications to vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine are a known and documented history of severe and/or immediate allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or a component of the vaccine. In addition, individuals with a history of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection are considered to have a precaution to vaccination. Both these groups of individuals should consult with an allergist-immunologist to discuss vaccination strategies prior to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

The COVID-19 vaccines do not have latex, eggs, or gelatin. As such, the CDC does not consider allergies to these substances to be contraindications or precautions to COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, the CDC does not consider allergies to other oral drugs or environmental factors to be contraindications or precautions to vaccination.

Because individuals in the clinical trials received no other vaccinations within 14 days of COVID-19 vaccination (including the influenza vaccine), there is only limited data on coadministration with other vaccines. As such, it is currently recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine not be administered within 2 weeks of another vaccine.

## Recommendations for Individuals with Past COVID-19 or Exposure to COVID-19

The clinical trials showed that individuals with past COVID-19 infection still received the vaccine safely and efficaciously. As such, past COVID-19 is not a medical contraindication or precaution to vaccination. However, while vaccine supplies are still limited, it is recommended that individuals that have been diagnosed with COVID-19 AND received monoclonal antibody treatment in the previous 90 days defer their vaccination until at least 90 days have passed due to the low risk of reinfection during that timeframe.

Individuals that have had a confirmed exposure to COVID-19 should not go into the community to get a vaccine until their quarantine has ended to prevent transmission of the virus. However, if the patient is in a congregate setting where healthcare services can be provided without exposing the community or healthcare workers, the patient can receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

## Individuals with Chronic Conditions

The clinical trials included individuals with a wide range of common chronic conditions; conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity, asthma, COPD, etc., are not contraindications to vaccination for COVID-19 -- and indeed, individuals with these conditions are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and should be vaccinated.

HIV and other immunocompromising conditions are not contraindications to vaccination because the COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines, meaning that they should not pose a particular safety risk to immunocompromised individuals. The clinical trials included individuals with HIV and found that the vaccine was still efficacious, though often somewhat less than for individuals without HIV, and was still safe. Immunocompromised individuals should speak with their treating physician to discuss the optimal timing of receiving the vaccines, particularly if they are on immunomodulatory medication.

There is currently no evidence suggesting that autoimmune conditions, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), or Bell's palsy are associated with the COVID-19 vaccines. As such, the CDC states that a history of these conditions is not a contraindication to vaccination; individuals with autoimmune conditions, GBS, or Bell's palsy can receive the COVID-19 vaccines unless they have a separate contraindication.

Finally, there were some reports that individuals with a history of injectable dermal filler usage experienced rare instances of swelling near the filler site after receiving an mRNA vaccine (i.e. Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna). These cases are relatively rare and are easily treated without serious complications. As such, the CDC recommends that a history of dermal filler injection is not a contraindication to vaccination, but if swelling is observed at filler sites after the vaccine, that the patient should contact their physician.

## Pregnant and Lactating Individuals

There is no evidence or reason to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines pose a safety risk to the mother or the child when administered to pregnant or lactating individuals, particularly after the vaccination of hundreds of millions of individuals around the world. In addition, pregnant women are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, with an increased risk of poor outcomes to both the mother and the child.

As such, though the clinical trials did not explicitly test the vaccine in pregnant women, based on the safety data and vaccination experience to date, the CDC recommends that pregnant women be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. This is a view shared by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.

Similarly, there is no reason to believe that the vaccine will pose a risk in lactating women, so they are also eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

# What side effects should I expect after vaccination, and when should I seek medical care?

Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine can include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. In addition, you may experience fatigue, muscle and joint pains, fever, chills, nausea, headaches, sweating, swollen lymph nodes, or other flu-like symptoms. These are a sign that the body is generating an immune response and is developing protective immunity.

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) recommends that you call a doctor if:

* Your arm pain, redness, or swelling continues to worsen more than 24 hours after you received the vaccine, or
* Your symptoms do not resolve within a few days, or
* If you are worried about your symptoms for any other reason.

Severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, such as anaphylaxis, are very rare, especially more than 15 minutes after the vaccine. However, if you believe you are having a severe allergic reaction or other sever reaction, it is recommended that you should seek emergency medical care. Symptoms of anaphylaxis [include](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html):

* Throat tightening, difficulty breathing
* Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* Dizziness, fainting, palpitations, flushing, pallor
* Hives, redness, itchiness, immediate and marked swelling
* Agitation, confusion

This condition is quite rare and is easily treatable with prompt medical attention. Virtually all cases of anaphylaxis will present immediately, within 15 minutes of vaccination. However, being mindful of these symptoms is nonetheless wise.

# What are the current guidelines on NSAID use before and after vaccination?

Per [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/prepare-for-vaccination.html), it is not recommended that you stop taking any medications that you are currently on without first consulting with your physician. If you are taking NSAIDs daily for management of a chronic medical condition, you should not stop taking them before the COVID-19 vaccine without asking your physician.

The CDC recommends not taking additional medications beyond your daily medication regimen, including NSAIDs or acetaminophen (Tylenol), before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.

After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC does not have specific data or recommendations on whether NSAIDs or acetaminophen will reduce efficacy of the vaccine. However, the participants in the clinical trials for the vaccines were not told to avoid NSAIDs or acetaminophen after the vaccine, and there is not evidence suggesting that the vaccine was less efficacious in individuals that did take these medications. As such, unless you have a specific medical condition that prevents you from taking these drugs, most institutions recommend NSAIDs or acetaminophen for relief of side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

# What are the current guidelines on alcohol or marijuana use before and after vaccination?

The participants in the clinical trials were not instructed to avoid alcohol or marijuana after the vaccine, and there is not specific data that would suggest it impacts vaccine efficacy. However, it is important to keep in mind that both alcohol and marijuana carry health risks of their own, and using these drugs or others can exacerbate side effects from the vaccine, which can unnecessarily delay recovery.

# Is there a relationship between vaccine side effects and protection from COVID-19?

Individuals in the clinical trials that reported few-to-no side effects were still protected with more than 90% efficacy, as were individuals that reported significant side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines. As such, there is no reason to believe that there is any significant relationship between the vaccine side effects and the protection conferred by the vaccine.

# Would emergence of a vaccine-resistant variant require full clinical trials for an updated vaccine?

Though not all regulatory bodies or jurisdictions have made firm indications, the US FDA has [indicated](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) that minor updates to approved vaccines to cover future variants of SARS-CoV-2 would not need to undergo a separate three-phase trial; rather, an expedited immunogenicity trial can be conducted to verify that the vaccine produces an immune response against the variant of the virus, and the vaccine could be quickly authorized and distributed as an amendment to the previous authorization or approval.",1617979697.0,618.0

This week we have two spectacular AMA guests lined up:

**Wednesday, April 7th, 11am EST** - [Dr. Tom Frieden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Frieden) is an infectious disease and public health expert who served as the Director of the CDC for the Obama Administration, and is the former Health Commissioner of New York City ('02-'09).

**Thursday, April 8th, 1pm EST** - [Dr. Vincent Racaniello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Racaniello) is a Higgins Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is also co-author of a textbook on virology, ""Principles of Virology"", as well as the host of the well-known virology podcast [This Week in Virology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Week_in_Virology)

As we have always done, these AMA's will be posted 1hr *before* they go live, so that we can have questions ready for the guest to just come in and hit the ground running!

We hope these two AMAs can answer the many nagging questions I'm sure a lot of you have about vaccines, vaccine side effects, variants, spread, and just about anything that has to do with SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID19!",1617726944.0,0.0

9184,An update on recent subreddit events,"Hey all,

Recently, our team voted to temporarily go private in order to join many other communities in protest of Reddit’s hiring practices. Just a few hours later, [the Reddit CEO's announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/) was posted and we immediately made the subreddit public once more. 

If any breaking news had been released in relation to public health during the time we were private (e.g., a release from the WHO, CDC or such), we would have absolutely opened the sub up for that. We were monitoring for this throughout. We made the [vaccine finder](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq/vaccinefinder), the only real time sensitive thing we have on the sub, available in the message users saw when we made it private.

We, like many other moderator teams, discuss and vote on major decisions so that differences in opinions can be heard and disagreements that do occur can be resolved in an amicable fashion. However, in this particular instance, the top moderator at the time opposed our decision and, within days, removed several moderators, restricted the permissions of the rest, and began inviting a new moderation team unrelated to the subreddit.


Yesterday, after detailed discussions, the now-former top moderator resigned and the original team was restored. We are now actively working to restore any changes that were made and return to providing high quality information on the COVID-19 pandemic. We would also like to take this time to refute all of the rumors that began to spread regarding the personal character of the former top moderator. These rumors and personal attacks are categorically false, and we do appreciate him working with us to restore the original mod team and put r/Coronavirus back on track.

Many of us have been here for more than a little while, and we've all put in countless hours into making the subreddit tick.  We haven't been perfect, but we've tried our hardest to make sure the r/Coronavirus community is one we could be proud of, and we hope that you can be proud of it too. We are glad that the former top moderator has done the right thing and we are looking forward to getting back to work.

The mod team is looking into compiling an organized list of vaccine-finding resources to help people locate vaccination locations, available appointments, and scheduling information to receive the COVID-19 vaccine! We're looking for any suggestions that anyone may have that can help with any of these goals!

It doesn't have to be big or nationwide -- we'll do our best to compile statewide or citywide resources as well. Nor does this list have to be dedicated solely to the United States -- vaccine locators around the world are welcome.

Thank you for your help!
