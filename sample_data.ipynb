      "Your body \"Remembers\" viruses when you have been infected by them.  It makes it easier and quicker to identify them so if you come in contact with them again your body can kill it typically before you even notice any symptoms.  Vaccines work to essentially pretend to be that virus so your body kills it and remembers it before the real virus gets to you.  However, over time you immune system can somewhat \"forget\" about a virus and it can take more time for it to recognize the infection and react.  Boosters essentially keep a virus at the forefront of the attention of your immune system.\n",

      "The variable is the virus mutation rate.  If I virus mutates into different variants your body will not immediately recognize it as the same disease so will have to spend time trying to figure out what it is and the best way to kill it.  Meanwhile, you have a fever, vomiting, etc.\n",
