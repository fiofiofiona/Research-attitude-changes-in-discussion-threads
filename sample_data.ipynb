       "  '**Effects on Reproductive Health Are Unknown**\\n\\nThe consent form also specifies that the effect on sperm, fetuses and nursing children are unknown. Yet health authorities and media have espoused as “fact” that the shot does not affect reproductive health or fertility and is perfectly safe for pregnant and nursing mothers.\\n\\nIf an effect is unknown, by definition you cannot claim it to be harmless. If you do, you are lying, plain and simple, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Rochelle Walensky is but one in a long list who is guilty of this. She has repeatedly assured the public that the jab poses no health risks to pregnant women or their babies. Here’s Walensky in May 2021:\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/WSgNTUjzwxQ](https://youtu.be/WSgNTUjzwxQ)\\n\\nAnd here she is, in October 2021, still claiming there are no risks.\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/yKh\\\\_kPptRGY](https://youtu.be/yKh_kPptRGY)\\n\\nSimilarly, in August 2021, when Comirnaty was licensed, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, claimed the COVID jab was safe during pregnancy:\\n\\nVideo may not work on all browsers\\n\\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also make definitive statements about safety, claiming “Vaccination may occur in any trimester, and emphasis should be on vaccine receipt as soon as possible to maximize maternal and fetal health.”2 Yet even the Comirnaty label3,4 states that “available data on Comirnaty administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine associated risks in pregnancy.”\\n\\n**Antibody-Dependent Enhancement Has Not Been Ruled Out**\\n\\nMany who have warned about the possibility of mRNA shots causing antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) — a situation in which you end up being more susceptible to serious infection than you would have been otherwise — have been smeared and demonized by media and labeled as disinformation spreaders.\\n\\nYet Pfizer’s own consent form clearly states: “Although not seen to date, it cannot yet be ruled out that the studied vaccine can make a later COVID-19 illness more severe.” As noted by Iversen, if ADE truly was of no concern at all, the consent form would not include it. Yet there it is.\\n\\nVaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) is also listed as an “Important Potential Risk” in Table 5 on page 11 of a document called “5.3.6 Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse Event Reports.”5\\n\\nAs of February 28, 2021, Pfizer had 138 cases of suspected VAED, 75 of which were severe, resulting in hospitalization, disability, life-threatening consequences or death; a total of 38 cases turned out to be lethal and 65 remained unresolved. \\\\[6,7\\\\]\\n\\nMoreover, as noted by the Daily Expose,8 “Phase 3 clinical trials are designed to uncover frequent or severe side effects before a vaccine is approved for use, including ADE. But herein lies the problem, \\\\[because\\\\] none of the COVID-19 vaccines have completed Phase 3 trials.”\\n\\nPfizer’s Phase 3 trial is due to be completed February 8, 2024 — nearly two years from now! Despite that, Pfizer concluded in its FDA submission that “None of the 75 cases could be definitively considered as VAED.”',\n",

Pfizer’s own trial showed infection was significantly more common in the vaccine group than the placebo group — 409 versus 287 — within the first seven days of the jab.',\n",

The exception is higher age groups where you start to see far more deaths in the unvaccinated. This is the complete opposite of the claims in the fraudulent graph.\",\n",

       "  '\"Kim Iversen reviews newly released documents related to Pfizer\\'s Covid-19 vaccine research.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAccording to the CDC people who were unvaccinated and did not have prior COVID-19 infection remain at the highest risk of infection and hospitalization.  Those who were previously infected, both with or without prior vaccination, had the greatest protection.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAdditionally, a study by The Cleveland Clinic found that both previous infection and vaccination provide substantial protection against COVID-19.  Vaccination of previously infected individuals does not provide additional protection against COVID-19 for several months, but after that provides significant protection at least against symptomatic COVID-19.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nMore than 559 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been given in the United States from December 14, 2020, through March 28, 2022.  According to Pfizer and the CDC, potential side effects from the vaccine include pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.  Other side effects could include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, fever, chills, and nausea.  In rare cases, people have experienced serious health events after the COVID-19 vaccination. Any health problem that happens after vaccination is considered an adverse event. An adverse event can be caused by the vaccine or can be caused by a coincidental event not related to the vaccine.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAccording to the CDC: Although the overall risks are low, if you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 compared to people who are not pregnant.  Evidence continues to build showing that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe and effective. It suggests that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCOVID-19 vaccines cannot cause COVID-19 infection in anyone, including the mother or the baby. None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain live virus. Vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 in people who are breastfeeding. Recent reports have shown that breastfeeding people who have received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have antibodies in their breastmilk, which could help protect their babies. More data are needed to determine what level of protection these antibodies may provide to the baby.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThere is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems (problems trying to get pregnant) in women or men.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThere is limited research on COVID-19 vaccination and the menstrual cycle.  However, research to date has found no meaningful change in menstrual cycle length associated with COVID-19 vaccination. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nCurrently, no evidence shows that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause male fertility problems. A recent small study of 45 healthy men who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine looked at sperm characteristics, like quantity and movement, before and after vaccination. Researchers found no significant changes in these sperm characteristics after vaccination.  However, one study found that COVID-19 infection may be associated with a decline in fertility for men for up to 60 days after infection.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe National Library of Medicine defines ADE as the enhancement of virus entry and replication. ADE not only promotes the virus to be recognized by the target cell and enters the target cell, but also affects the signal transmission in the target cell.  Studies show that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can cause a strong neutralizing antibody response in rodents, and antiserum does not mediate ADE.\"\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/5eJ5TIT6zvk',\n",
       "  'On April 1, 2022, another batch of 11,000 Pfizer documents were released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pfizer trial data reveal natural immunity was as effective as the jab, and that shot side effects were more severe in those under 55.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe documents also reveal that Pfizer’s consent form specifies that “the effect on sperm, fetuses and nursing children are unknown”. Yet health authorities and media have espoused as “fact” that the shot does not affect reproductive health or fertility and is perfectly safe for pregnant and nursing mothers.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nPfizer and the FDA also knew that people of all ages experienced transient suppression of immune function for one week after the first dose\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut what’s perhaps most shocking of all is that Pfizer’s documents show they’ve not ruled out the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) is listed as an “Important Potential Risk”, and as of February 28, 2021, Pfizer had 138 cases of suspected VAED, 75 of which were severe, resulting in hospitalization, disability, life-threatening consequences or death; a total of 38 cases were lethal and 65 remained unresolved.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n\\n\\nIn the end, the COVID jab will go down in history as the biggest medical malfeasance ever to occur with the willing participation of both drug companies and regulatory agencies. And there’s no end in sight.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIn March 2022, the FDA went ahead and authorized doses 4 and 5, based on a preprint study23,24 that found **a fourth Moderna shot was 11% effective and caused side effects in 40% of recipients, and a fourth Pfizer shot was 30% effective and caused side effects in 80% of people.**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI’m not sure what it’ll take for this public health nightmare to end and for the responsible parties to be held to account for their criminal negligence, but apparently, we’ve not hit critical mass outrage yet.\\n\\nhttps://dailyexpose.uk/2022/04/15/fda-pfizer-knew-covid-jab-causes-immunosuppresion/',\n",

       "  '**Conclusions**  \\nThere has been an unwavering message about the safety and efficacy  \\nof mRNA vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 from the public health  \\napparatus in the US and around the globe. The efficacy is increasingly in  \\ndoubt, as shown in a recent letter to the Lancet Regional Health by  \\nGünter Kampf (2021b). Kampf provided data showing that the vacci-  \\nnated are now as likely as the unvaccinated to spread disease. He  \\nconcluded: “It appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated  \\npopulation as a possible and relevant source of transmission when  \\ndeciding about public health control measures.” Moreover, the in-  \\nadequacy of phase I, II, and III trials to evaluate mid-term and long-term  \\nside effects from mRNA genetic vaccines may have been misleading on  \\ntheir suppressive impact on the innate immunity of the vaccinees.  \\nIn this paper, we call attention to three very important aspects of the  \\nsafety profile of these vaccinations. First is the extensively documented  \\nsubversion of innate immunity, primarily via suppression of IFN-α and  \\nits associated signaling cascade. This suppression will have a wide range  \\nof consequences, not the least of which include the reactivation of latent  \\nviral infections and the reduced ability to effectively combat future in-  \\nfections. Second is the dysregulation of the system for both preventing  \\nand detecting genetically driven malignant transformation within cells  \\nand the consequent potential for vaccination to promote those trans-  \\nformations. Third, mRNA vaccination potentially disrupts intracellular  \\ncommunication carried out by exosomes, and induces cells taking up  \\nspike glycoprotein mRNA to produce high levels of spike-glycoprotein-  \\ncarrying exosomes, with potentially serious inflammatory conse-  \\nquences. Should any of these potentials be fully realized, the impact on  \\nbillions of people around the world could be enormous and could  \\ncontribute to both the short-term and long-term disease burden our  \\nhealth care system faces.\\n\\nGiven the current rapidly expanding awareness of the multiple roles  \\nof G4s in regulation of mRNA translation and clearance through stress  \\ngranules, the increase in pG4s due to enrichment of GC content as a  \\nconsequence of codon optimization has unknown but likely far-reaching  \\nconsequences. Specific analytical evaluation of the safety of these con-  \\nstructs in vaccines is urgently needed, including mass spectrometry for  \\nidentification of cryptic expression and immunoprecipitation studies to  \\nevaluate the potential for disturbance of or interference with the  \\nessential activities of RNA and DNA binding proteins.\\n\\nIt is essential that further studies be conducted to determine the  \\nextent of the potential pathological consequences outlined in this paper.  \\nIt is not practical for these vaccinations to be considered part of a public  \\nhealth campaign without a detailed analysis of the human impact of the  \\npotential collateral damage. VAERS and other monitoring systems  \\nshould be optimized to detect signals related to the health consequences  \\nof mRNA vaccination we have outlined. We believe the upgraded VAERS  \\nmonitoring system described in the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc.  \\nstudy, but unfortunately not supported by the CDC, would be a valuable  \\nstart in this regard (Lazarus et al., 2010).  \\nIn the end, billions of lives are potentially at risk, given the large  \\nnumber of individuals injected with the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines  \\nand the broad range of adverse outcomes we have described. We call on  \\nthe public health institutions to demonstrate, with evidence, why the  \\nissues discussed in this paper are not relevant to public health, or to  \\nacknowledge that they are and to act accordingly. Furthermore, we  \\nencourage all individuals to make their own health care decisions with  \\nthis information as a contributing factor in those decisions.',\n",

If 0.5-1% had released then we wouldn't be here. There's about 1.3 trillion tons of methane in the Arctic seabed alone, not including tundra permafrost.

Creating a world war scenario, global pandemic, food shortage, everything shortage, engineered famine, economic catastrophe and setting up a nuclear fall scenario with Russia to slow down the super heating.

Some important notes on the study, it was conducted on cancer cells, not representative of normal human cells, using a concentration of vaccine much much higher than you would get with a vaccine, was performed in a petri dish and did not show any DNA entering the cell nucleus.\\n\\nI don't see what moderna would gain by knowingly altering the DNA of billions of people.

A human liver cell line (or any cell line for that matter) is a tumorous cell colony that is often far mutated from their original tissue. The Huh7 cell line in particular has between 55 to 63 chromosomes, relative to a healthy human 46. It wasn\\'t chosen because of 4chan, it was chosen because other studies have found it grows well in Huh7 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33903110/. However, there are other cell lines that also work https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255622.\\n\\nThere\\'s a difference between reverse transcription and gene editing. Gene editing requires that the DNA be re-integrated into the genome, not just be free floating DNA fragments. The study states https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73/htm:\\n\\n> At this stage, we do not know if DNA reverse transcribed from BNT162b2 is integrated into the cell genome.\\n\\nTherefore it does not sufficiently prove gene editing.\\n\\ngp130 is not a gene, it\\'s a component found in many genes. That\\'s why disrupting gp130 is bad, because it\\'s disrupting the function of a whole class of genes. However the only gene involved here is TLE5, and the RT sequence does not \"contain\" TLE5, as seen in your screenshot, the gene itself has length 10,056, your query sequence only matches 138 bases of that. A piece of a gene has completely different behavior from the full gene, therefore anything related to TLE5 is irrelevant to a 138bp fragment of it.',\n",

Natural immunity is much more robust and effective.  It also adapts to the new viruses where the vaxx can't.

When they start the new vaxx this fall it will start the cycle over again.\",\n",

       "  'The vaccines were the gateway drug fro the virus....',\n",
       "  \"This is not accurate. For a start, the vaccinated are not at more risk than the unvaccinated. This sort of thing keeps getting repeated due to poor readings of the data. In some locations this is due to their being more people who are hospitalized or dying who are vaccinated than unvaccinated, while ignoring that older people are more likely to be vaccinated (and even an old person who is vaccinated is still at more risk than an unvaccinated young person), and also ignoring that there are a lot more vaccinated people than unvaccinated people. When you take these into account, these sorts of patterns go away.  See [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination). \\n\\nIn the UK, there are two additional complicating factors. First, much of the UK did a really good job vaccinating people who are in high risk jobs, like teachers and bus drivers. Second, the UK made testing highly available and some of the vaccinated were much more likely to test frequently than the unvaccinated.\\n\\nBut putting all of this aside, the basic claim here doesn't make sense. Viruses can't look ahead and see that there are vaccines, and somehow decide to mutate. Mutation is primarily a function of reproduction rate. That means that the more cases we have, the more chances there are for new variants to arise. That by the way is part of why vaccines are not the only important safeguard we have, but NPIs like mask wearing (especially high quality masks like N-95s and KN-95s) remain important.\\n\\n> But where this gets really worrying is this: each new variant is seeing this relative risk rate rise and the rate of rise is accelerating. \\n\\nIt is true that the overall size of each spike has gone up over time. That is due to the virus mutating with Delta being more transmissible than early variants and Omicron being more transmissible than even earlier ones. One would hope that this would eventually end when everyone has gotten the virus or has gotten vaccinated,. However, the evidence is that Omicron by itself doesn't give strong immunity against other variants in unvaccinated. See [here](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(22\\\\)00159-7). So we're not going to get herd immunity form that alone. And each of these spikes is showing a larger death total. Even as Omicron was less deadly than Delta, it was still about as deadly as the initial strains, which combined with a lot of people getting it. Hence the major spike the US just went through, the spike the UK is going through now(EDITED: removed incorrect descriptor, see discussion below), and the apparent signs were seeing of a new wave in the US,  such as increasing numbers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as increases in wastewater numbers in multiple locations. See for example [here for Boston](https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm). This could combine badly with the general reduction in masking and other safeguards; many people both in the general public and people who are nominally in public health have decided that we can just get rid of all safeguards, but this does not follow.\\n\\nThe good news to some extent is that in many places, new anti-virals will at least reduce the hospitalization and death rate. Paxlovid is particularly good in this regard, showing a strong indication of reducing death and hospitalization in both vaccinated and unvaccinated. Unfortunately, paxlovid itself may have a short window of full efficacy, and so unless people are testing regularly, it may not do much. And if the next spike is bad, there may not be enough of the new anti-virals to go around. In the US, this is a definite concern because congress refused Biden's request to buy paxlovid on a large scale. \\n\\nThis means that other interventions, like vaccines, masking, and social distancing remain important steps to protect you and those around you.\",\n",

       "  'This is a copy of my letter to HR edited to hide names and company. \\n\\nHR,\\n \\nI wanted to inform you of a conversation I had with (BOSS), which I can only assume he plans to brief you on.\\n \\nAs it pertains to the announcement this morning regarding the OSHA mandate that requires any unvaccinated person to wear a mask effective Monday Jan 17th, I want to express my concerns.  Please understand that I am fully aware that this is not a (company name) decision, and that (company name) is simply complying with OSHA guidelines.  However, since the CDC has admitted and acknowledged that the vaccines made to fight COVID neither prevent contraction nor do they stop transmission (https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/cdc-director-covid-vaccines-cant-prevent-transmission-anymore/ar-AASDndg) I feel the mask requirement solely for the unvaccinated is discriminatory based on what should be a private medical decision.  If the mask requirement applied to all individuals regardless of vaccination status then I would have no issues with complying, however I cannot and will not allow myself to be subjected to any form of discrimination or the potential for harassment from others by visibly displaying private medical status by wearing a mask, especially considering the volatile opinions some have as it relates to vaccination status and Covid. \\n \\nIt is also my personal belief that OSHA is out of line mandating vaccinations or masks, as that constitutes practicing medicine without a license.  Neither OSHA nor (company name) have reviewed my medical history to make the determination that either of these options are safe for me.  Furthermore as it relates to actually getting the vaccine, since the only FDA approved vaccine is the Phizer vaccine, and they have petitioned the FDA/Courts to suppress adverse trial data requested via FOIA for 55 years, accepting the vaccine under “informed consent” (a basic human right) is not possible. https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-requests-55-years-to-complete-foia-request-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine\\n \\nI have talked to (Boss) and informed him that I am fully aware that my non-compliance will likely lead to termination, and I am ready to accept that however I certainly hope other arrangements can be discussed.\\n\\nThis was before SCOTUS finally ruled and then they dropped it anyway.',\n",

Ask what the infection rate is in the workplace pre and post vaccine to ensure infection rates are highest among the vaccines. Also ask for who is liable if you experience side effects.
